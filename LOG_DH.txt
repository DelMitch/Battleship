Tried some pair programming and TDD. CATCH is an interesting system though I don't quite have the right mind set to think up the boolean it needs to test. Pair programming was so so, caught a minor error, but I'm not sure it was particularly helpful as they would have been quickly found with compile errors.

I wonder if we'll address timing/profiling tests?... can CATCH do those? Something to look up.

CATCH is hard to use with psuedo-gui or proper gui stuff or arrays. Wrote an isShip function for use in placing ships and determining hits along with a test. Also started work on board setup functions. Did pair programming work to develop these. Partner push stuff to Git.
